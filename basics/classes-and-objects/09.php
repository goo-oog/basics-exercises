/*## Exercise #9

Finish [bank-account.php](09.php)

Add the following method:

```php
function show_user_name_and_balance() { }
```

Your method should return a string that contains the account's name and balance
separated by a comma and space. For example, if an account object named `ben`
has the name "Benson" and a balance of 17.25, the call of `ben.show_user_name_and_balance()` should return:

```
Benson, $17.25
```

There are some special cases you should handle. If the balance is negative,
put the - sign before the dollar sign. Also, always display the cents as a two-digit number.
For example, if the same object had a balance of -17.5, your method should return:

```
Benson, $17.50
```*/
