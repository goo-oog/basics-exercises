/*## Exercise #10

See [video-store.php](10.php)

The goal of this optional exercise is to design and implement a simple inventory control system
for a small video rental store. Define least two classes: a class Video to model a video
and a class VideoStore to model the actual store.

Assume that a Video may have the following state:

 - A title;
 - a flag to say whether it is checked out or not; and
 - an average user rating.

In addition, Video has the following behaviour:

 - being checked out;
 - being returned;
 - receiving a rating.

The VideoStore may have the state of videos in there currently.
The VideoStore will have the following behaviour:

 - add a new video (by title) to the inventory;
 - check out a video (by title);
 - return a video to the store;
 - take a user's rating for a video;
 - list the whole inventory of videos in the store.

Finally, create a VideoStoreTest which will test the functionality of your other two classes.
It should allow the following:

 - Add 3 videos: "The Matrix", "Godfather II", "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope".
 - Give several ratings to each video.
 - Rent each video out once and return it.
 - List the inventory after "Godfather II" has been rented out out.

Summary of design specs:

 - Store a library of videos identified by title.
 - Allow a video to indicate whether it is currently rented out.
 - Allow users to rate a video and display the percentage of users that liked the video.
 - Print the store's inventory, listing for each video:
    - its title,
    - the average rating,
    - and whether it is checked out or on the shelves.*/
