/*## Exercise #5

Create a class called *Date* that includes: three pieces of information as instance variables — a month, a
day and a year.

Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that
the values provided are correct.
Provide a set and a get for each instance variable.

Provide a method DisplayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes '#/#'  .

Write a test application named DateTest that demonstrates class *Date* capabilities.*/
